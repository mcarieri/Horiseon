# Horiseon

Though I ran into the occasional challenge, I feel confident in the work I've done with this first challenge.

-I began with first cleaning up some semantics in the HTML code, adding brackets, apostrophes, etc where needed. 
-I then validated the links on the html, making sure they connect to where needed.
-I added necessary alt tags to all images.
-I consolidated the CSS code as well to make it tidier and more organized.
